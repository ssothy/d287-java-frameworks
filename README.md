# WESTERN GOVERNOR UNIVERSITY 
## D287 â€“ JAVA FRAMEWORKS

C. I changed the name and title to Sami's Stuffies (Not for sure if I like the name or not yet) I customized the H2 
headers to reflect my website's products more. Added some styling to make the aesthetics of the page match my theme
to demo.css and then linked the styling in the headers of the templates.

D. I added an about page with a button to line 21 in mainscreen. The about has a simple statement about what the shop
sells. The about is able to link back to the main screen through a link in the main header in line 13 in about html.
I created an about Controller that includes the mapping request to the about page in the Controllers folder. 

E. I added sample data in BootStrapData.java of 5 different accessories/dresses for the stuffed animals as well as 5 
different stuffed animals.I had complications with it duplicating but after emptying out the repository I hope it 
stays at it's correct amount. I also used a simple conditional checking that the repositories are at 0 in order to
input the entries without duplicates.
