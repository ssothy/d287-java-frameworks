# WESTERN GOVERNOR UNIVERSITY 
## D287 â€“ JAVA FRAMEWORKS

C. I changed the name and title to Sami's Stuffies (Not for sure if I like the name or not yet) I customized the H2 
headers to reflect my website's products more. Added some styling to make the aesthetics of the page match my theme
to demo.css and then linked the styling in the headers of the templates.

D. I added an about page with a button to line 21 in mainscreen. The about has a simple statement about what the shop
sells. The about is able to link back to the main screen through a link in the main header in line 13 in about html.
I created an about Controller that includes the mapping request to the about page in the Controllers folder. 

E. I added sample data in BootStrapData.java of 5 different accessories/dresses for the stuffed animals as well as 5 
different stuffed animals.I had complications with it duplicating but after emptying out the repository I hope it 
stays at it's correct amount. I also used a simple conditional checking that the repositories are at 0 in order to
input the entries without duplicates. 

F. I added Buy Now buttons to the table on mainscreen by adding a form to hold the button on line 88. I created success 
and error html pages to display the corresponding messages. To get those messages to display accordingly I had to create 
the buyProduct function in ProductServiceImpl.java on line 69 that was implemented in productService.java on line 19
The buyProduct function checked the inventory of the product ID gathered from the form and sends whether it's an error 
or successful purchase to the controller I made in ProductController.java that sends the message to be displayed in the 
html pages. I then had to create controllers for the success and error pages which were simple like the about controller
in the previous step.
